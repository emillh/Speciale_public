SalesAgent: Thank you for reaching out. Could you please tell me the name of your company?
Customer: Certainly! Our company is called Innovate Inc.
SalesAgent: Thank you for sharing that. What are the primary goals that Innovate Inc. is looking to achieve with this project?

SalesAgent: Got it, that sounds important. Can you describe the type and sub-type of application you're looking to implement on your assembly line?
Customer: The primary application is pick-and-place for our 'widget assembly line', specifically for PCB (Printed Circuit Board) assembly.
SalesAgent: Thank you for the detailed information. May I know who would be the best contact person for this project at Innovate Inc.?

SalesAgent: Great, Alex. Do you happen to know if you are the decision-maker for this project, or is there someone else involved in that process?
Customer: Yes, I am the primary decision-maker for the technical evaluation. However, the final budget approval will come from our Director of Operations, Ms. Jane Smith.
