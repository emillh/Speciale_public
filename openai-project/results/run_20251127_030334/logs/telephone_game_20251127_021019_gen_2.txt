SalesAgent: Thank you for explaining your goals. Could you share more about the level of skill and expertise your in-house team has with automation technologies?

SalesAgent: No worries at all. Is Ms. Jane Smith the decision-maker for this project, or is there anyone else involved in the decision-making process?
Customer: The final budget approval is done by Ms. Jane Smith, our Director of Operations, so she is the key decision-maker for the financial aspect of the project.
SalesAgent: Thank you for that clarification. Could you describe the type of application you're looking to automate and any sub-types that might be relevant?
Customer: I'm afraid I don't have specific details about the application type and sub-type at this moment. It's not a priority right now.
