SalesAgent: Got it! Can you describe the variety of parts you are currently working with or plan to work with in your production line?
Customer: We work with five different types of components that are similar in size and shape. Each component measures approximately 10mm x 10mm x 5mm and weighs less than 5 grams.
SalesAgent: Thank you for the details! Can you elaborate on the skill level of your in-house team regarding automation technologies?
Customer: Our in-house team has a beginner skill level regarding automation technologies.

Customer: The key decision makers for our project include Ms. Jane Smith, the Director of Operations, who will be involved in budget approvals. Additionally, the lead assembly line operator will participate in discussions related to user acceptance testing. Demonstrating a clear return on investment (ROI) is crucial for our selection process.
SalesAgent: Thank you for that information! Can you provide details about the specific types of applications or processes you envision the automation solution addressing?
Customer: At the moment, I don’t have specific details on the applications or processes we want to automate. Our main focus is on increasing production speed and efficiency while ensuring worker safety.
SalesAgent: Certainly! Can you tell me more about your expectations for the deployment process once the automation solution is implemented?
Customer: We prefer a phased deployment process, starting with one station to prove the concept before rolling it out to the entire line. This approach will help ensure we are on the right track.
SalesAgent: Thank you for that insight! Could you describe any specific performance metrics or criteria you will use to evaluate the success of the automation project?
Customer: I don't have specific performance metrics or criteria to share at the moment. Our main focus is on increasing production speed, efficiency, and worker safety as indicators of success for the automation project.
