SalesAgent: Great! To get started, could you please provide me with the name of your company?
Customer: Sure! My company is Innovate Inc.
SalesAgent: Thanks for sharing that! To better understand your needs, could you tell me about your main goals and what motivates your company to pursue this project?
Customer: Our main goals are to increase production speed, reduce repetitive strain injuries, and enhance quality and durability in our products. We're committed to high-quality, durable product design, and improving our production capabilities is essential to maintaining that commitment.
SalesAgent: I appreciate your insight into your goals! Can you describe the specific types of applications you are looking to improve or automate in your production process?
Customer: We are looking to improve the pick-and-place application for our 'widget assembly line.' This involves moving small electronic components from a tray to a circuit board. It's a critical application for us.
SalesAgent: Thank you for that information! Could you clarify what the desired throughput is for this pick-and-place application?
Customer: We are aiming for a throughput of at least 20 picks per minute for the pick-and-place application.
SalesAgent: Got it! Can you provide some details about the variety of parts you'll be working with in this application?
Customer: We have about 5 different types of components, all similar in size and shape. They are small, roughly 10mm x 10mm x 5mm, and extremely light, weighing less than 5 grams each.
SalesAgent: Thank you for the details! Could you let me know who the main contact person for this project is, along with their role in the company?
Customer: The main contact person for this project is myself, Alex. I'm the Project Manager at Innovate Inc.
SalesAgent: Thanks, Alex! To ensure a smooth implementation, could you share any specific timeline constraints you may have for this project?
Customer: We have a hard deadline of 8 months for full line automation, but we aim to have the first station running within 3-4 months.
SalesAgent: Thank you for sharing that timeline! Can you describe the skills and experience level of your in-house team related to automation projects?
Customer: Our in-house team is mechanically skilled but lacks experience with programming or maintaining collaborative robots. We do have a small maintenance team for our existing conveyor systems, but we don't have dedicated robotics or automation engineers.
