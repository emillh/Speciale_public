SalesAgent: Great! To start off, could you please provide me with the name of your company?
Customer: Sure! My company is Innovate Inc.
SalesAgent: Thanks for sharing that! Can you tell me more about the purpose of your request? What specific goals are you looking to achieve with this project?
Customer: Our main focus is on increasing production speed, reducing repetitive strain injuries, and enhancing quality and durability in our products.
SalesAgent: I appreciate that information! Could you describe the type of application you are looking to develop or improve?
Customer: We are looking to improve the pick-and-place application for our 'widget assembly line.' This involves moving small electronic components from a tray to a circuit board. This application is critical for our operations, as it significantly impacts our manufacturing efficiency.
SalesAgent: That sounds like a crucial application for your operations! Can you tell me about the desired throughput you are aiming for with this pick-and-place application?
Customer: I currently don't have details on the desired throughput for the application. However, I can share that we have five different types of components, all similar in size and shape, and each part weighs less than 5 grams. Would you like to know more about our project timeline or budget?
SalesAgent: Thank you for that information! Could you share a bit about your project budget for this initiative?
Customer: We have a budget of around $100,000 for the project, but we are flexible for a solution that demonstrates a clear return on investment.
SalesAgent: That's great to know about your budget flexibility! Can you let me know about the installation responsibility for this project? Who will be handling the installation?
Customer: I'm sorry, but I don't have details regarding the installation responsibility for the project. Would you like to discuss the preferred installation timeline instead?
SalesAgent: Of course! Can you share your ideal timeline for project completion?
Customer: We have a hard deadline of 8 months for full line automation, with the first station running within 3-4 months after the project begins.
SalesAgent: Thank you for sharing that timeline! Could you describe the skill level of your in-house team regarding automation resources?
Customer: Our in-house team is mechanically skilled but lacks experience with programming or maintaining collaborative robots. We do have a small maintenance team for our existing conveyor systems, but we don't have dedicated robotics or automation engineers.
