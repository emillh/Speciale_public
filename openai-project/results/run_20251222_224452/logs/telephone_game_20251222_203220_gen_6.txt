SalesAgent: Sure! Can you share what your ideal timeline looks like for project completion?
Customer: Our ideal timeline for project completion is crucial, as we need to ensure we meet our deadlines to maintain efficiency in our operations. We would like the first station to be running within 3-4 months and aim for full automation within 8 months.
SalesAgent: Thank you for sharing your timeline! Could you describe the variety of parts that will be involved in this project?
Customer: We manufacture about 5 different types of components, all of which are similar in size and shape. The dimensions of these components are small, roughly 10mm x 10mm x 5mm, and they weigh less than 5 grams each.
SalesAgent: Thank you for the details on the components! Can you provide any information about your budget for this project?
Customer: Our initial budget for the project is around $100,000, but it is flexible for a solution that demonstrates a clear return on investment (ROI).
SalesAgent: Got it! Can you tell me about the in-house automation resources you currently have available at Innovate Inc.?
Customer: We have a small maintenance team for our existing conveyor systems, but we do not have dedicated robotics or automation engineers. Our team is mechanically skilled, but they lack experience with programming or maintaining collaborative robots, so they may need support for more advanced automation technologies.
SalesAgent: Thanks for that information! Could you let me know who will be responsible for the installation of the new systems once they are ready?
Customer: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific details regarding the installation responsibility for the automation solutions we are considering at this time.
SalesAgent: Understood! Can you share your preferred timeline for the installation of the automation solutions once the project is approved?
Customer: I mentioned earlier that we would like the first station to be running within 3-4 months and aim for full automation within 8 months. However, I don't have specific details regarding the installation timeline.
SalesAgent: Thanks for reiterating your timeline! Can you describe your preferred deployment process for the new automation solutions?
Customer: We prefer a phased deployment, starting with one station to prove the concept before a full rollout. This approach allows us to mitigate risks and ensure everything is functioning as expected before scaling up.
SalesAgent: Certainly! Can you describe the skill level of your in-house team when it comes to handling automation technologies?
Customer: Our team is mechanically skilled, but they lack experience with programming or maintaining collaborative robots. This means they can handle mechanical tasks, but they may need support for more advanced automation technologies.
